abstract: >-
  SpinCirc is a comprehensive MATLAB/Python/Verilog-A framework 
  implementing the equivalent-circuit spin-transport formalism for 
  computational spintronics research. It features 4Ã—4 conductance 
  matrix formalism, time-dependent drift-diffusion solvers, and 
  advanced magnetodynamics with LLG/LLGS integration.
